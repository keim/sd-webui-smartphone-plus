## How It Works

1. **CSS Injection**: The extension dynamically injects responsive CSS rules that override the default WebUI styles for mobile devices
2. **Custom UI Panel**: A floating control panel is inserted into the interface, providing quick access to common operations
3. **Event Listeners**: JavaScript monitors tab changes and user interactions to provide seamless mobile experience
4. **Viewport Optimization**: Sets the interactive-widget meta tag to ensure proper mobile browser behavior

## Compatibility

- Tested with AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion WebUI
- Works on iOS and Android browsers
- Best experience on screen widths < 768px
- Compatible with most SD WebUI extensions

## Tips for Mobile Use

1. Use **Props** toggle to hide advanced settings you don't frequently adjust
2. Use **Negative** toggle to maximize screen space for the main prompt
3. Create size presets for your commonly used dimensions
4. Save frequent prompts to the clipboard manager
5. Use the word selection tools for precise prompt editing without a mouse
